						Data Center management has evolved from a simple alert system into a critical element that
enables maximum availability, cost efficiency, and controllability. As the data centers grow
larger, data center management techniques are growing at an enormous rate with attendant
critical issues to overcome. The paper presented here is the application of a supervisory web-
based information and control system of the Data Center management system. The overall
system design is achieved through arrayed sensors linked to a stationary embedded server with
collaborative mobile robots on-boarded with sensors. The mobile telerobotic elements are able
to assess the physical condition of the environment inside the Data Center, and mobile robots
work as dynamic agents that can conduct testing and maintenance collaboratively and
intelligently.The project is composed of the following three novel mechanisms: standard
architecture of information systems of hybrid remote control system; efficient patentable ladder
transformations of lightweight DC robots carrying another tiny robot; and a simple yet efficient
semi-autonomous “Cobe algorithm” for Data Center mobile robots.

						The aim of the project is to build a stationary embedded server and two mobile robots to be
controlled remotely in the data center management. At the project stage, the main concern is to
build a basic online remote control system for a mobile robots and an embedded server as a
tools for an efficient and real time monitoring system. In this way, users, IT operator and
administrator with different level of access authentication are able to
get an on-demand information system about our data center's activities.

						To avoid repetition of previous technological works in telerobotics and data centre management,
this project development concentrates on the aspects of combining both disciplines specific to
information systems. These includes: hybrid control systems, flexible mobile robots platforms,
simple but efficient path algorithms, portable system design and resource control, and the
overall architecture of the system. It also includes the user interface, as this is constrained to
operate within the confines of standard computer hardware - a mouse keyboard and monitor.
Everything in the project resources will rely on open-sources software and its featured
advantages. This project documents some of the different information systems of the previous
mentioned technologies that have been developed and discusses how they have been implemented.
